            All Initial Process Fee funds are fully refundable after 3 months
            (less credit card transaction fees) if you have not purchased a real
            estate property through use of our system. As the blockchain is time
            sensitive, refunds are made only on request which must be received
            by us in writing within five (5) days after three (3) months from
            your IPF payment. Unless you seek refund, youâ€™ll have elite access
