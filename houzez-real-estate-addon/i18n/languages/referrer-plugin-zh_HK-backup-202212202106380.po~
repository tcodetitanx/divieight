"This plugin allows users to signup when they are referred by another user. "
"Users can subscribe by buying a subscription plan. All subscribed users get "
"a certain discount for all products. <b>Note</b>: The discount is not "
"applied for admins (to avoid saving a discounted price in the database) and "
"when the user is in the thank you page (to avoid applying to discount before "
"getting the commission to pay the referrer)."
